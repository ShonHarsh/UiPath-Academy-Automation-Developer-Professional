# UiPath Academy Automation Developer Professional

This project is a study guide to support the UiPath Automation Developer Professional course.  The course is free at the [UiPath Academy](https://www.uipath.com/rpa/academy).  There are many courses and even a survey (at present, a "Take the career guidance survey: button) you can take and AI will suggest where to start.

**Note:** This content does not replace the training in the UiPath Academy.  This is meant as a supplement for review.

### Architecture Requirements

###### Markdown
You are most likely familiar with markdown, however for the sake of clarity, it is a lightweight formatting language.  It is viewable and even quite readable in a text editor but viewing markdown interpreted as it is intended is even better.  Some markdown viewers are:

- [Atom](https://atom-editor.cc/) - While the IDE Atom has been archived, it still works and performs well.  This is my favorite interface for markdown.
- [Atom GitHub](https://github.com/atom/atom) - The GitHub page for Atom.  I am adding it here should the official page go offline.
- [MarkText](https://www.marktext.cc/) - A very lightweight markdown viewer.
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - A popular text editor that works also.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - VSCode should need no introduction.

###### UiPath
A standard UiPath, Studio to Orchestrator cloud setup is the base of operation.  It is easy to setup and free.
1. An Orchestrator connection - Visit https://cloud.uipath.com/ and authenticate or sign up.
2. [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/product/studio) is used to run the robot.  Note that Studio Web can be used directly in Orchestrator but I recommend installing the Studio IDE application.
